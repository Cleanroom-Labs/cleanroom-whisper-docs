Test Plan
=========

Introduction
---------------

This test plan covers MVP requirements (:need_count:`type=='req' and 'whisper' in tags` functional requirements, :need_count:`type=='nfreq' and 'whisper' in tags` non-functional requirements).

--------------

Test Strategy
----------------

Test Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~

=========== ====================== ======================
Level       Scope                  Tools
=========== ====================== ======================
Unit        Individual functions   Rust ``#[test]``
Integration Component interactions Rust integration tests
System      End-to-end workflows   Manual testing
=========== ====================== ======================

Features Not Tested
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===================== ====================
Feature               Reason
===================== ====================
whisper.cpp internals Third-party software
OS audio APIs         Platform dependency
SQLite engine         Third-party software
===================== ====================

Test Automation Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MVP:** Manual testing only. Automation deferred until post-MVP stabilization.

**Unit tests (automatable):**

+------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Component        | What to Test                     | Mock Strategy                   |
+==================+==================================+=================================+
| db.rs            | CRUD operations                  | In-memory SQLite (``:memory:``) |
+------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| whisper.rs       | Command building, output parsing | Mock ``Command`` output         |
+------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| audio.rs         | WAV file format validation       | Pre-recorded test files         |
+------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------+

**Integration tests (partially automatable):**

======================= ====================
Test                    Automation Notes
======================= ====================
Database + file storage Use temp directories
Settings persistence    In-memory database
Path validation         Unit testable
======================= ====================

**System tests (manual only):**

================ =============================
Test             Why Manual
================ =============================
Tray icon states Requires visual verification
Global hotkeys   Requires OS-level interaction
Audio recording  Requires microphone hardware
Notifications    Platform-specific behavior
================ =============================

**Mock whisper.cpp:** For CI, create a simple binary that echoes test input:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   # mock-whisper.sh - Returns predictable output for testing
   echo "This is a test transcription."
